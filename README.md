# Cancer-Detection-ML-Project
# ðŸ§¬ Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression

This project implements a *Logistic Regression* model to detect cancer based on patient data. The model is trained using the liblinear solver and aims to predict the *diagnosis* column in the dataset (typically malignant or benign tumors).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- *Objective*: Predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using logistic regression.
- *Target column*: diagnosis
- *Model used*: LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')
- *Preprocessing*: MinMaxScaler, Train-Test Split

---

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

The dataset used is typically the *Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset*. You can load it via sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer() or use a CSV file.

- Features: Various measurements of cell nuclei (radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.)
- Target: diagnosis â€” M = Malignant, B = Benign
